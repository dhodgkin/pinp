    <h3>Been Pinpin'</h3>
    <p>Development on Pinp is moving along.</p>
    <p>The view class is getting some pretty decent functionality. It now has several functions: display(), ::yield(), ::partial(), ::linkTo(), and a ::scripts() function is in the works.</p>
    <p>Documentation is low on my list of priorities right now, but once I get a few more things done that I have clanging around in my head I may start on it. Be patient it'll be here soon.</p>
