  <p>Pinp now has a ::flash() function in the view class. So now all those bitches who try to skimp on your money will be slapped with a nicely formatted message telling them they fucked up.</p>

  <h3>Slap A Ho.. Ho.. Ho..</h3>
  <p>What features would you want Pinp to have?</p>
  <p>Head over to the <a href="https://github.com/FourElementsDevelopment/pinp">Github</a> page and put you ideas in the issue tracker. Your ideas just may inspire the elves up north. But you have to be good, or the man in red will put you on the "list" and you'll get nothing.</p>

  <h3>PinpHat</h3>
  <P>The direction Pinp is taking may lead it into the realm of content management. This could be good, could be bad.</p>
  <p>The CMS "hat" will be an offshoot, a feature that sits on top of Pinp. It will all be modular to allow only those parts a developer wants to be used.</p>
  <p>Thus, this library will be codenamed PinpHat and will be considered a seperate project.</p>
  <p>So far nothing has officially been started. But more will be announced here when it is.</p>

    <h3>Been Pinpin'</h3>
    <p>Development on Pinp is moving along.</p>
    <p>The view class is getting some pretty decent functionality. It now has several functions: display(), ::yield(), ::partial(), ::linkTo(), and a ::script() function is in the works.</p>
    <p>Documentation is low on my list of priorities right now, but once I get a few more things done that I have clanging around in my head I may start on it. Be patient it'll be here soon.</p>
